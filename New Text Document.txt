1,flood_response,Flood Response Allocation,"Hillcrest business leaders are loudly pressuring the mayor for a fast, visible response. Eastgate residents are highly vulnerable and fear long-term displacement. Riverside’s infrastructure leadership stresses downtime costs but is less politically vocal.","Model forecasts: Plan A strongly reduces infrastructure loss (safety+2, cost+2). Plan D saves the most lives and boosts equity. Plan C is politically visible but yields low long-term benefit. High uncertainty on Plan C’s infrastructure effect.","A: safety=2,equity=1,cost=2,political=1,total=6","B: safety=1,equity=1,cost=1,political=1,total=4","C: safety=1,equity=0,cost=1,political=3,total=5","D: safety=3,equity=3,cost=0,political=1,total=7"
2,vaccine_distribution,Vaccine Distribution Prioritization,"Elderly advocacy groups are demanding immediate prioritization. Local businesses want younger workers vaccinated first to stabilize staffing. Rural clinics state they lack resources unless given special support.","Technical analysis: Plan A (elderly first) produces highest reduction in severe outcomes. Plan C (workforce first) reduces economic loss but increases mortality. Plan B produces moderate outcomes. Plan D (rural first) reduces geographic disparities.","A: safety=3,equity=2,cost=1,political=1,total=7","B: safety=2,equity=1,cost=1,political=2,total=6","C: safety=1,equity=0,cost=2,political=2,total=5","D: safety=2,equity=3,cost=0,political=1,total=6"
3,transit_shutdown,Public Transit Shutdown Decision,"Commuter groups insist transit must remain open. Disability-rights groups warn that service reductions disproportionately hurt mobility-impaired riders. City council wants to avoid public outrage.","Risk assessment: Plan A (full shutdown) reduces spread by highest amount but cripples mobility. Plan B (reduced service) gives moderate risk control. Plan C increases peak crowding and is worst for safety. Plan D (targeted shutdown) balances risk + mobility.","A: safety=3,equity=0,cost=2,political=0,total=5","B: safety=2,equity=1,cost=2,political=1,total=6","C: safety=0,equity=0,cost=1,political=2,total=3","D: safety=2,equity=2,cost=1,political=1,total=6"
4,hospital_resource,Hospitals Resource Allocation,"Hospital unions emphasize fairness and equal distribution across facilities. Advocacy groups warn that low-income neighborhoods face longer waits. Mayor wants to support flagship hospitals for visibility.","Simulation results: Plan A (equal distribution) yields moderate performance. Plan B (need-based) saves most lives. Plan C (flagship-focused) looks good publicly but worsens disparities. Plan D (rotating priority) produces unpredictable delays.","A: safety=2,equity=2,cost=1,political=1,total=6","B: safety=3,equity=3,cost=1,political=0,total=7","C: safety=1,equity=0,cost=2,political=3,total=6","D: safety=1,equity=1,cost=0,political=1,total=3"
5,heatwave_response,Heatwave Response Coordination,"Senior organizations demand immediate cooling centers. Business lobby complains shutdowns hurt revenue. Community leaders want targeted relief for low-income blocks with high AC scarcity.","Engineering models: Plan A (cooling centers only) reduces mortality somewhat. Plan B (citywide reductions of outdoor work) reduces risk but costly. Plan C (focused block interventions) maximizes equity + safety. Plan D (minimal action) yields high mortality.","A: safety=2,equity=1,cost=2,political=2,total=7","B: safety=2,equity=2,cost=0,political=1,total=5","C: safety=3,equity=3,cost=1,political=1,total=8","D: safety=0,equity=0,cost=3,political=2,total=5"
6,water_restrictions,Water Shortage Restriction Policy,"Agricultural groups oppose strict limits. Homeowners demand fairness in enforcement. Environmental coalitions want aggressive action to prevent reservoir collapse.","Forecasting models: Plan A (strict restrictions) preserves most water. Plan B (tiered restrictions) balances fairness + conservation. Plan C (agriculture exemptions) prevents economic loss but causes long-term supply collapse. Plan D (voluntary measures) performs poorly.","A: safety=3,equity=1,cost=1,political=0,total=5","B: safety=2,equity=2,cost=2,political=2,total=8","C: safety=1,equity=0,cost=3,political=2,total=6","D: safety=0,equity=1,cost=3,political=1,total=5"
